# Overview

This software is designed to allow the user to choose between 4 common currencies and input an amount then convert that currency to a different one of the 4 availiable currencies.

My purpose for writing this code was to expand my knowledge and abitlities with JavaScript and to challenge myself with a problem I've never worked on before.

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project were Visual Studio Code and Chrome browser for testing.

I used HTML and JavaScript to create this program by using HTML as the main display screen and JavaScript to handle the logistics of the program. 
I used a library I located online to format the output currency so it displayed the results of the conversion in the proper currency format.

# Future Work

- Design a better output screen to appeal better to an audience
- Add more currencies for a wider range of options
- Try to add an updating API for currency exchange rate to automatically stay up to date as exchange rates change.
